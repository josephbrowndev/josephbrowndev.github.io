Joseph Browns AI Combat Portfolio
Hello my name is Joseph Brown and I am a game designer!  This is my portfolio that I will be keeping updated with more and more projects I continue to work on!  
My favorite part of desingning videogames is working with the AI combat, behaviors, and even life cycles!

I love tower defense games, idle games, and fun action packed games that have great animations and VFX.

I am a graduate from Full Sail university and am excited to push myself to design this website to show some more skills!  

I am seeking employment and would love to design anything with a great group of people!  So if you know anyone looking for an AI engineer please send them my way I would love to show them my portfolio and what i can hlep them with.
